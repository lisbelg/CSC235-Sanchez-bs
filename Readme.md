# Sample Bootstrap plain html page

[Bootstrap Documents] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)

## 1. Navbar
I selected the Navbar component because it improves site navigation and makes sure the page layout is responsive across different screen sizes.

## 2. Card
I selected the Card component because it provides a clean way to organize content and it improves visual structure.
